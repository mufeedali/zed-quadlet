# Examples

Examples are LLM-generated and tweaked to be syntactically valid. Intended to test the syntax highlighting and LSP.

Any warnings you see from `quadlet-lsp` from these examples should be bugs in `quadlet-lsp`.

## Warning

These are NOT intended to actually work. If they do work, that's an accident.
